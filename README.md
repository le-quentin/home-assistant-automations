# home-assistant-blueprints
A repo for my home-assistant blueprints.

This is public so that home-assistant can point at it directly and get updates. There's nothing private in there anyway since they're just blueprints, they're not referencing any concrete device in my house. Feel free to use/fork those as you see fit.
